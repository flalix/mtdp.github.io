This will save both time and space.\nUse efficient storage (if you’re dumping stuff in files, Parquet is a good choice).\nUse categoricals for recurring strings (but note that it may not be worth it if there’s not much repetition).\nOnly select the columns you need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf your colleagues are happy with CSVs and can’t be convinced to use something else, tell them that the Modern Polars book says they should feel bad.\n\n\nThese are basically the same rules you’d follow when using Pandas, except for the one about the lazy API.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used in research, promising acceleration and deeper results. However, besides caution, it demands rigorous validation. Assessing complex biological relationships, like those between molecular pathways and diseases, remains challenging for SQL-based tools and LLM models. Here, we introduce the Digital Pathway Curation (DPC) pipeline to systematically evaluate the reproducibility and accuracy of the Gemini models against PubMed search and human expert curation. Using the COVID-19 proteomic study for different cases and the Medulloblastoma (MB) transcriptomic study for different subtypes, we created a large dataset (Ensemble) based on determining pathway-disease associations. With the Ensemble dataset, we demonstrate that Gemini achieves high run-to-run reproducibility of approximately 99% and inter-model reproducibility of around 75%. Next, we calculate the crowdsourced consensus using a smaller dataset by integrating the “3 Sources”: Gemini, PubMed and human evaluations. The CSC allows us to calculate each accuracy, and the Gemini multi-model consensus reached a significant accuracy of about 87%. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs are reproducible, reliable, and valuable tools for navigating complex biomedical knowledge using a well-formatted natural language query."

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nThe scientific method - based on observation, hypothesis generation, feasible and reproducible experimental design, execution, data annotation, data analysis, hypothesis testing, and communication - relies on evidence and reproducibility. Moreover, the literature review is a crucial first step. Since most scientific literature stored in PubMed is published following peer review, one infers that all these articles follow the scientific method and are based on evidence, a statement questioned by some 8–12. Since PubMed is a reproducible SQL-based engine, the responses are identical once queried using the same search terms in a short interval between queries. However, PubMed’s accuracy is not as high as expected, particularly concerning false positives and negatives, which are often overlooked.\nIn the present study, Digital Pathway Curation confirms whether selected pathways are involved in modulating due to a disease. To establish a reproducibility measure, we propose using artificial intelligence, specifically the Gemini LLM models. The first step of our pipeline involves creating a large set of queries, called the Ensemble model. We can assess hard reproducibility by comparing the responses between runs or models. Additionally, we introduce a consensus method, which identifies the most frequently chosen answer among “four different but semantically similar questions” (4DSSQ). Using this consensus, we propose a measure of soft reproducibility, which involves comparing the results from different runs or models based on the consensus results.\nNext, we propose a smaller dataset called “3 Sources” dataset (3SD), based on a list of “two cases of randomly selected pathways” (2CRSP), containing randomly selected pathways for each case. This dataset includes a list of 30 pathways that Gemini, PubMed, and Human respond to related to each disease case or subtype. With 3SD results, we can calculate the crowdsourced consensus score (CSS25) and assess the accuracy of each source.\nThe DPC pipeline evaluates the ability of LLMs to determine whether selected pathways are involved in modulating due to a disease, utilising GSEA results based on the Reactome database. Given an omic study, DPC selects calculated pathways stored in the GSEA pathway table using the “four pathway groups” method. These pathways are then used to perform the Ensemble dataset analyses.\nThe Ensemble dataset comprises the four pathway groups containing tens or hundreds of pathways. It incorporates at least two Gemini models and four distinct semantic forms of questions posed at different times, called runs. This dataset allows for evaluating the run-to-run, inter-model, and semantic reproducibilities. To analyse the semantic reproducibility, we introduced the concept of the “four different and semantically similar questions” (4DSSQ). Additionally, Tiwari et al. from the EMBL-EBI developed a similar approach to test the Reactome database completion using ChatGPT24. We also compared the Ensemble answers with those obtained from PubMed searches.\nThe CSC allows us to assess the accuracy of each source. Using the source with the best accuracy according to the CSC, we can uncover False Positives (FP) and False Negatives (FN) while also confirming True Positives (TP) and True Negatives (TN) among the enriched pathways calculated with GSEA.\nIn the upcoming sections, you will find a detailed description of each method and the results obtained."
