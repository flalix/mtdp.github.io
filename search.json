    "text": "1.1 How much is too much?\nMany people don’t need to be told why method chaining is nice. Many languages make it easy to write thing.min().abs().str() instead of str(abs(min(thing))).\nBut the Python standard library tends to prefer the ugly way, so if you’ve spent a lot of time doing vanilla Python stuff, you may have become accustomed to writing nasty nested function calls or declaring intermediate variables like min_thing. This is sad because a sensible degree of method chaining can make code a lot easier to read.\nIt’s not always easy for libraries to accommodate method chaining - in fancy terms, to be fluent interfaces. Even Pandas used to be much less fluent: when Modern Pandas was released, methods like assign and pipe were quite recent.\nFortunately Polars is very fluent. The expression API provides a very elegant way to do a bunch of stuff to a dataframe in one fell swoop, and Polars mostly doesn’t mutate dataframes in-place (method chaining with side effects is often a bad idea).\nLet’s see how this looks in practice by cleaning up the flight data we gathered in ?sec-indexing.\n:::\nSome items to note:\nThe above examples have some fairly long method chains that could perhaps be split up. That said, if I saw them in a PR I probably wouldn’t mind. Here’s a chain that’s too long:\nI would argue this code is not hard to follow, but empirically it provokes disgust in people. I think it’s just visually shocking, which is often a hallmark of terrible code. That’s enough reason to avoid doing this. You don’t want folks assuming you’ve lost your mind.\nIn the above example, it would probably be enough to just move those long lists to their own variables. That would make it more obvious that the code is really doing simple, menial things.",

Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used in research, promising acceleration and deeper results. However, besides caution, it demands rigorous validation. Assessing complex biological relationships, like those between molecular pathways and diseases, remains challenging for SQL-based tools and LLM models. Here, we introduce the Digital Pathway Curation (DPC) pipeline to systematically evaluate the reproducibility and accuracy of the Gemini models against PubMed search and human expert curation. Using the COVID-19 proteomic study for different cases and the Medulloblastoma (MB) transcriptomic study for different subtypes, we created a large dataset (Ensemble) based on determining pathway-disease associations. With the Ensemble dataset, we demonstrate that Gemini achieves high run-to-run reproducibility of approximately 99% and inter-model reproducibility of around 75%. Next, we calculate the crowdsourced consensus using a smaller dataset by integrating the “3 Sources”: Gemini, PubMed and human evaluations. The CSC allows us to calculate each accuracy, and the Gemini multi-model consensus reached a significant accuracy of about 87%. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs are reproducible, reliable, and valuable tools for navigating complex biomedical knowledge using a well-formatted natural language query.",

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nThe scientific method - based on observation, hypothesis generation, feasible and reproducible experimental design, execution, data annotation, data analysis, hypothesis testing, and communication - relies on evidence and reproducibility. Moreover, the literature review is a crucial first step. Since most scientific literature stored in PubMed is published following peer review, one infers that all these articles follow the scientific method and are based on evidence, a statement questioned by some 8–12. Since PubMed is a reproducible SQL-based engine, the responses are identical once queried using the same search terms in a short interval between queries. However, PubMed’s accuracy is not as high as expected, particularly concerning false positives and negatives, which are often overlooked.\nIn the present study, Digital Pathway Curation confirms whether selected pathways are involved in modulating due to a disease. To establish a reproducibility measure, we propose using artificial intelligence, specifically the Gemini LLM models. The first step of our pipeline involves creating a large set of queries, called the Ensemble model. We can assess hard reproducibility by comparing the responses between runs or models. Additionally, we introduce a consensus method, which identifies the most frequently chosen answer among “four different but semantically similar questions” (4DSSQ). Using this consensus, we propose a measure of soft reproducibility, which involves comparing the results from different runs or models based on the consensus results.\nNext, we propose a smaller dataset called “3 Sources” dataset (3SD), based on a list of “two cases of randomly selected pathways” (2CRSP), containing randomly selected pathways for each case. This dataset includes a list of 30 pathways that Gemini, PubMed, and Human respond to related to each disease case or subtype. With 3SD results, we can calculate the crowdsourced consensus score (CSS25) and assess the accuracy of each source.\nThe DPC pipeline evaluates the ability of LLMs to determine whether selected pathways are involved in modulating due to a disease, utilising GSEA results based on the Reactome database. Given an omic study, DPC selects calculated pathways stored in the GSEA pathway table using the “four pathway groups” method. These pathways are then used to perform the Ensemble dataset analyses.\nThe Ensemble dataset comprises the four pathway groups containing tens or hundreds of pathways. It incorporates at least two Gemini models and four distinct semantic forms of questions posed at different times, called runs. This dataset allows for evaluating the run-to-run, inter-model, and semantic reproducibilities. To analyse the semantic reproducibility, we introduced the concept of the “four different and semantically similar questions” (4DSSQ). Additionally, Tiwari et al. from the EMBL-EBI developed a similar approach to test the Reactome database completion using ChatGPT24. We also compared the Ensemble answers with those obtained from PubMed searches.\nThe CSC allows us to assess the accuracy of each source. Using the source with the best accuracy according to the CSC, we can uncover False Positives (FP) and False Negatives (FN) while also confirming True Positives (TP) and True Negatives (TN) among the enriched pathways calculated with GSEA.\nIn the upcoming sections, you will find a detailed description of each method and the results obtained.",
